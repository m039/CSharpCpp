# True intention

This is a note for a stranger, who as me, is looking for the answer how to translate his C# code to C++ (or vice versa), I have bad and good news for you.

Bad: in general it is a bad idea, sometimes very bad, most of companies offer AOT, not translators. But what I also realize, it could be very good if you know exactly how your transpiler works.

Good: if you want to translate code from one programming language to another on a daily basis, then what you exactly want is a new language (or existing one, e.g., [Ä†](http://cito.sourceforge.net)). Think of it as C# and C++ are very different languages, a main difference is GC, you cann't translate freely from one code to another, but if you have a new language (subset of both) you can translate with ease.
