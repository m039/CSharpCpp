# SharpCpp

SharpCpp is a transpiler that generates C++ code from C# code. Currently only [XLIS](https://github.com/m039/XLIS)'s FooBar example is working and nothing else.

_It is just a raw idea, highly experimental and future of the project is unknown. [Read more..](https://github.com/m039/SharpCpp/blob/develop/DevJournal.md)_

# Usage
* You can use MacOS Application to test functionality, there are no other options for now.
* [Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) is needed for the library to work.
